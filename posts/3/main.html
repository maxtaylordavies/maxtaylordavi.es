<h1>Self-hosting for fun and profit</h1>

<main>
<p>When I first started out messing around with web projects, I used Heroku for everything. This was a good choice - I knew virtually nothing about infrastructure, devops or anything like that, and for the reasonable price of $9/month, Heroku let me focus on what I was actually interested in learning - writing code. However, while $9/month is not a ton of money, it isn't zero, and as a pretty broke student I had to cut costs where I could. I considered moving to a simpler, more do-it-yourself hosting option like DigitalOcean or Linode - but eventually thought, why not just go all the way and start hosting everything myself? Yeah, there would likely be some sort of upfront cost, but I figured I would save money in the long run by getting rid of any monthly fee. Plus, I would probably learn something along the way.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>My server hardware is a single Raspberry Pi 3 with 1GB RAM and a 32GB sd card. This is connected by ethernet to my home network, and there is a rule in my router config that allows external requests to the pi's IP on ports 80 and 443.</p>
<h3>Systemd</h3>
<p>Every piece of custom code that runs on my pi is managed using systemd. This lets me start, restart or stop any application with a single command - it also lets me start everything automatically on boot, which is handy for when the pi is accidentally unplugged and has to reboot. ðŸ˜¬</p>
<h3>Switchboard</h3>
<p>Running on ports 80 and 443 is a small piece of Go software I wrote called <a href="https://github.com/maxtaylordavies/switchboard">switchboard</a>. Switchboard is basically a simple reverse proxy - it handles every incoming request to the pi, and redirects it to a different port on localhost depending on the <code>request</code> object's <code>Host</code> field. The mapping between hosts and ports is defined in a small YAML file, which is parsed into a <code>map[string]int</code> when the service starts up. There are a couple of advantages to this approach. First, it means that the domain names for all my projects (which I manage through GoDaddy) can point to exactly the same IP. Second, it means that I only have to worry about TLS for Switchboard itself - for everything else I can use a simple <code>server.ListenAndServe()</code> on whatever port I want while still benefitting from https.</p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>All of the web applications running on the pi have a backend written in Go, using a similar template that relies only on the standard library's <code>net/http</code> package - no third-party server code required. For simple sites like this one, that backend just serves straightforward templated html + css using Go's <code>template/html</code>. For more complex sites that need a bit more interactivity, I write a separate frontend in React (typescript), and the Go backend serves the static files output by <code>yarn build</code>. Using systemd means that I can build and restart both the Go backend and React frontend with a single command, so managing these applications isn't really any more complicated than the simple static ones.</p>
<h3>Deployer</h3>
<p>The last major component of the setup is a custom CI/CD service running on the pi that I call <a href="https://github.com/maxtaylordavies/deployer">deployer</a>. Deployer accepts a POST request containing the name of one of my repos - it then pulls the latest version of the repo from Github, and rebuilds + restarts it using <code>systemctl restart</code>. A second field in the request body conveys whether or not the repo's systemd service file has itself been modified - in this case Deployer has to also replace the old service file and run <code>systemctl daemon-reload</code> before restarting the application. As well as the Go code, the Github repo for Deployer also contains a reusable Github Actions workflow that handles calling the service. This workflow is then imported by all my other repos in their own minimal workflows - so anytime I push a commit to the master branch of a project, it gets automatically rebuilt + redeployed on the pi without me having to do anything.</p>
